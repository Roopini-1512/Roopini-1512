# Hey there! I'm Roopini <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GouthamKumar-R/GouthamKumar-R/master/wave.gif" width="30px">


<h3 align="center">Data-Scientist from India</h3>

I am a Data Scientist with a Postgraduate degree in Data Science and a Google Cloud certification. My academic foundation in statistics, machine learning, and advanced analytics laid the groundwork for my career, where I combine technical expertise with a strong business mindset.

Over the past several years, Iâ€™ve gained diverse industry experience across semiconductors (Lam Research), telecommunications (Verizon), retail (Nike), and quick-service restaurants (Wendyâ€™s). At these organizations, I have worked on projects spanning predictive modeling, machine learning deployment, data visualization, and advanced reporting.

I specialize in:

Machine Learning & Predictive Analytics â€“ building and optimizing models for forecasting, churn prediction, and workforce insights.

Cloud & ML Deployment â€“ hands-on with Google Cloud Vertex AI, Snowflake, Kubernetes, Docker, and MLflow to scale solutions from experimentation to production.

Business Intelligence â€“ designing impactful Power BI dashboards and analytics solutions that translate complex data into clear, actionable stories.

Cross-functional Collaboration â€“ bridging technical teams and business stakeholders to deliver measurable impact such as improved reporting efficiency, sales forecasting accuracy, and market benchmarking.

Beyond my professional work, I enjoy video editing and creative storytelling, which helps me bring clarity and narrative flow into the way I present data insights. Iâ€™m passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and empower organizations to make smarter, faster, and more confident decisions.
